    "## Challenge code\n",
    " \n",
    " On one hand, you are asked to complete `circuit` (you only need to apply gates). You can only call the `project_execution` operator once, which is already incorporated in the template. \n",
    " On the other hand, you must complete `process_output`, which will take the output of your circuit and will return who the lazy guy is.\n",
    " \n",
    " The `project_execution` function will be generated when testing the solution; if you want to experiment with the function output in the notebook, you can temporarily replace `project_execution` with an operator of the form `qml.MultiControlledX(wires=['e1', 'e2', 'e4', 'result'])`. In this case, the absence of \"e3\" on the wires means that in this project, \"e3\" will be the lazy employee. Just remember to switch it back to project_execution before submitting, so that your function uses the correct project_execution during testing!\n",
    " \n",
    " You may find it useful to do some tests in [Quirk](https://algassert.com/quirk) before you start coding.\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Output\n",
    " \n",
    " To judge this challenge, we will arbitrarily generate 5000 different projects (`project_execution`), which we will send one by one to the circuit to check that your prediction is correct (\"e1\", \"e2\", \"e3\" or \"e4\"). Therefore, in this case, there will be no public and private test cases. Good luck!\n",
