    " On the other hand you must complete `process_output`, which will take the output of `circuit` (a vector of dimension two where each term can take the value 0 or 1) and will return 2 if $U = RY(2\\pi/3)$ or 4 if $U = RY(4\\pi/3).$\n",

To judge whether your circuit works as expected, we will randomly send 5000 different examples and check that they always classified correctly. Therefore, in this question there are no public or private test cases. They are randomly generated.\n",
