    "## Challenge code\n",
    " \n",
    " You must complete the qnode `model` that will be in charge of obtaining different outputs. This model depends on a single parameter and you must ensure that it generates all the basis states.\n",
    " You must also define the function `generate_coefficients`, which will return a list with the 8 values of the parameter to generate these basis states.\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Output\n",
    " \n",
    " To judge this challenge, the `generate_coefficients` function will be called first. With the output of this function (the eight coefficients), we will call the model to ensure that the generated states are the desired ones. In addition, we will check that:\n",
    " - The model is continuous (small modifications of the parameter imply small modifications of the generated state). By putting the parameter inside rotation gates you will have no problems with this. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - The generated coefficients are in the interval [0,10]. Solutions that do not fit this interval will be considered incorrect.\n",
    " \n",
    " In this challenge, we will not work with public and private tests. We will simply check that all of the above is fulfilled. Good luck!\n",
    " ### Imports\n",
