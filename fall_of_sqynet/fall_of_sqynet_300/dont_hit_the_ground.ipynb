    "## Challenge code\n",

    " You must complete the `half_life` function to calculate the time $T$ at which the probability of measuring $\\lvert 1 \\rangle$ becomes 1/4.\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Input\n",
    " \n",
    " As input to this problem, you are given:\n",
    " \n",
    " - `gamma` (`float`): The zero-temperature photon loss rate.\n",
    " - `p` (`float`): The de-excitation probability due to temperature effects\n",
    "  \n",
    " ### Output\n",
    " \n",
    " This code will output a `float` equal to your estimate of the relaxation half-life. Note that you may require the step and iterations of your circuit to actually reach the half-life.\n",
    " \n",
    " If your solution matches the correct one within the given tolerance specified in `check` (in this case it's an absolute tolerance of `0.2`), the output will be `\"Correct!\"` Otherwise, you will receive a `\"Wrong answer\"` prompt.\n",
