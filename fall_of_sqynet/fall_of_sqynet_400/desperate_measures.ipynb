    "## Challenge code\n",
    " \n",
    " You must complete the `heisenberg_trotter` that implements the Trotterization of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian for $N=4$ using only the following PennyLane gates: `qml.RX` `qml.RY`, `qml.RZ`, `qml.CNOT`, and `qml.DepolarizingChannel`. This function will return a quantum state. You should also minimize the number of CNOT gates as much as you can, in order to avoid noise. To verify that the that the Trotterization that you proposed is not excessively noisy, we will calculate for you the fidelity of your output state with respect to the noiseless case using the `calculate_fidelity` function.\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Input\n",
    " \n",
    " As input to this problem, you are given:\n",
    " \n",
    " - `couplings` (`list(float)`): An array of length 4 that contains the coupling constants and the magnetic field strength, in the order $[J_x, J_y, J_z, h]$.\n",
    " - `p` (`float`): The depolarization probability on the target qubit after each CNOT gate.\n",
    " - `depth` (`int`): The Trotterization depth.\n",
    " - `time` (`float`): Time during which the state evolves.\n",
    "  \n",
    " ### Output\n",
    " \n",
    " This code will output a `float` corresponding to the fidelity between the output states of the noisy and noiseless trotterizations, calculated from the output of `heisenberg_trotter.` The outputs in the test cases correspond to the minimal fidelity that you should achieve if you used a small enough amount of CNOT gates.\n",
    " \n",
    " If your fidelity is larger, up to a tolerance of 0.005, of that specified in the output cases, your solution will be judged as `\"Correct!\"` Otherwise, you will receive a `\"Wrong answer\"` prompt.\n",
    " \n",
    " Good luck!\n",
    " ### Imports\n",
    " The cell below specifies the libraries you should use in this challenge. Run the cell to import the libraries. ***Do not modify the cell.***"
