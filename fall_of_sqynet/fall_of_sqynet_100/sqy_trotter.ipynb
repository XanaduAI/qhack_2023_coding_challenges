    "## Challenge code\n",
    " \n",
    " You must complete the `trotterize` function to build the Trotterization of the Hamiltonian given above. **You may not use** `qml.ApproxTimeEvolution` or `qml.QubitUnitary`, but feel free to check your answer using this built-in PennyLane function!\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Input\n",
    " \n",
    " As input to this problem, you are given:\n",
    " \n",
    " - `alpha` (`float`): The coefficient $\\alpha$ of the $X\\otimes X$ term in the Hamiltonian.\n",
    " - `beta` (`float`): The coefficient $\\beta$ of the $Z\\otimes Z$ term in the Hamiltonian.\n",
    " - `time` (`float`): The period $t$ over which the system evolves under the action of the Hamiltonian.\n",
    " - `depth` (`int`): The Trotterization depth $n$ as explained above. \n",
    "  \n",
    " ### Output\n",
    " \n",
    " This code will output a `list(float)` (list of real numbers) corresponding to the probabilities of measuring $\\lvert 00\\rangle,$ $\\lvert 01\\rangle,$ $\\lvert 10\\rangle,$ and $\\lvert 11\\rangle$ (in that order) of the Trotterization circuit that you implement in PennyLane. The initial state of the circuit is $\\lvert 00\\rangle$ and all measurements are performed in the computational basis.\n",
    " \n",
    " If your solution matches the correct one within the given tolerance specified in `check` (in this case, it's a relative tolerance of `1e-4`), the output will be `\"Correct!\"` Otherwise, you will receive a `\"Wrong answer\"` prompt.\n",
    " \n",
    " Good luck!#| ### Imports\n",
    " The cell below specifies the libraries you should use in this challenge. Run the cell to import the libraries. ***Do not modify the cell.***"
